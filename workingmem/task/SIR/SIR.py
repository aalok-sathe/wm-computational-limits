        key things to remember:
        1. we have n_reg registers and n_items items in total, but not all of them are
           used in every trial. only concurrent_reg are used. and same_diff_prob determines
           how items are drawn: if a 'same' outcome is picked, the same item is used for that
           register in the next trial. if a 'diff' outcome is picked, a new item is uniformly
           drawn from the item pool without replacement.
        2. ignore_prob determines the likelihood of an ignore instruction. if an ignore instruction
           is given, the register is not updated.
        3. locality determines the locality of the registers. if locality is None, registers are
           drawn uniformly from the register pool. if locality is an integer, registers are drawn
           from a local pool of registers that are within locality distance of the current register.
           in practice, this means, picking a start_idx uniformly from the range [0, n_reg) with
           wraparound, and picking registers uniformly without replacement from this range

        algorithm
        +-------+
        +--------- (this happens once at the level of the trial seq) -----+
        | 1. pick a start_idx uniformly at random from the range [0, n_reg)
        |     (start_idx exists to serve a case where locality is not None: when registers
        |     within a trial sequence are likely to occur with nearby registers---and never
        |     occur with registers outside of locality bounds)
        |     in practice, locality has not been used so far---this means that by default
        |     the entire range of n_reg roles is utilized to sample concurrent_reg from
        |
        | 2. choose concurrent_reg registers from the range
        |       [start_idx, start_idx + (locality or n_reg)) % n_reg
        |    and likewise choose concurrent_items items from the range [0, n_items)

        |    +-------- (repeat for seq_len steps) ----------------------------+
        |    | 3. pick one register to operate on from the chosen registers
        |    |   [3'] with probability `td_prob`, this role will be the same
        |    |      as the one exactly `n_back` steps ago
        |    |      [this has no bearing on what symbol is picked---with 50%
        |    |       prob we still have different symbols]
        |    |     if not all roles have been picked yet, pick from among those
        |    |      that haven't yet made an appearance---this avoids the case
        |    |      where we have role_n_congruence and n_back>0.
